## Introduction
CrimePatrol is a full-stack web application that provides a platform for citizens to report crimes in real-time. Leveraging the Django framework, the app offers a robust backend for managing reports, user authentication, and geospatial data. The frontend integrates Leaflet.js for interactive maps, allowing users to visualize crime data dynamically.

## Features
- **Real-Time Crime Reporting**: Citizens can submit detailed crime reports with descriptions, locations, and multimedia attachments.
- **Interactive Maps**: View reported crimes on an interactive map with clustering for better data visualization.
- **User Roles and Permissions**: Distinct roles for citizens, police, and admins ensure secure and appropriate access.
- **Secure Authentication**: User authentication through Django's built-in system and OAuth integration.
- **Media Uploads**: Attach images or videos to reports to provide more context and evidence.
- **Search and Filtering**: Easily search and filter reports based on crime type, location, and date.

## Architecture
CrimePatrol is architected to ensure scalability, security, and ease of use:

- **Backend**: Django powers the backend, utilizing Django Rest Framework (DRF) for creating RESTful APIs and Channels for real-time features.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with Leaflet.js) provide a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is used for its robustness and support for geospatial data.
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSockets and Channels allow for real-time updates and notifications.

### Workflow
1. **User Authentication**: Users register and log in using secure authentication methods.
2. **Report Submission**: Citizens report crimes with detailed descriptions and geolocation data.
3. **Data Storage**: Reports are stored in a PostgreSQL database, leveraging Django's ORM for efficient data handling.
4. **Map Visualization**: Reports are visualized on an interactive map using Leaflet.js and marker clustering.
5. **Admin Management**: Admins manage reports, users, and overall system settings through a secure admin interface.
